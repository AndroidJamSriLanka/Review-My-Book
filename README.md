Problem : when we want to buy a popular book or think of giving a gift to someone
	we must know if it is upto expectations.finding reviews for that book may be
	time consuming and hard.
	
Solution: I want tocreate an android application that will search any book by name or even isbn
	and give instant reviews on it from readersand critics.while providing them with pricing details.
	i want to add features like favorites in different catogories.
	i hope to use amazon/ebay apis, openlibrary org api , idrambooks api etc to achiive my goal
	please feel free to comment on this project
	thak you.
